    "Gradient Boosting trains many models in a gradual, additive and sequential manner. The major difference between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Algorithm is how the two algorithms identify the shortcomings of weak learners (eg. decision trees). While the AdaBoost model identifies the shortcomings by using high weight data points, gradient boosting performs the same by using gradients in the loss function (y=ax+b+e , e needs a special mention as it is the error term). The loss function is a measure indicating how good are model’s coefficients are at fitting the underlying data. A logical understanding of loss function would depend on what we are trying to optimise. We are trying to predict the sales prices by using a regression, then the loss function would be based off the error between true and predicted house prices."
